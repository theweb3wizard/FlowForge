# **App Name**: FlowForge

## Core Features:

- Wallet Connection: Allow users to securely connect their BlockDAG-compatible wallets (e.g., MetaMask, WalletConnect).
- Template Selection: Provide pre-audited, ready-to-deploy smart contract templates.
- Parameter Input: Collect deployment-specific values from the user.
- Contract Deployment: Deploy smart contracts to the BlockDAG testnet without writing code.
- Deployment Dashboard: Display a transparent, public list of all contracts deployed through FlowForge.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) — conveys trust, depth, and reliability.
- Background: Very light blue (#F0F9FF) — provides clarity and focus.
- Accent: Soft purple (#7E57C2) — creates futuristic, “wizard-tech” energy for CTAs and highlights.
- Text (Primary): Near-black blue-gray (#1E293B) — ensures readability.
- Success/Alert States: Green (#16A34A) / Red (#DC2626) For clear feedback messages.
- Headlines: Space Grotesk — futuristic and technical.
- Body: Inter — modern, legible, and balanced.
- Use geometric, minimal icons (outline style) for contract categories.
- Maintain a grid-based card layout (3-column for desktop, 1-column for mobile).
- Use soft shadows and rounded corners (border-radius: 12px) to maintain the professional aesthetic.
- Subtle hover glow for primary buttons (accent purple).
- Progress animations during contract deployment (loading bar or rotating icon).
- Fade-in transitions for form switching (Template → Parameters → Deploy).
- Success confetti or small burst effect upon contract deployment success (reinforces delight).
